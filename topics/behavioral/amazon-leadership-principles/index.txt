13:T1c02,# Amazon Leadership Principles

Amazon's Leadership Principles are the foundation of their culture and guide how Amazonians make decisions, solve problems, and interact with customers and colleagues.

---

## 1. Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

**Key Points:**
- Start with customer needs
- Work backwards from customer experience
- Earn and maintain customer trust
- Focus on customers over competitors

*Tags: #CustomerObsession #CustomerFirst #Trust*

---

## 2. Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."

**Key Points:**
- Think long-term
- Act for the entire company
- Take responsibility beyond your role
- Avoid short-term thinking

*Tags: #Ownership #LongTerm #Responsibility #Accountability*

---

## 3. Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

**Key Points:**
- Drive innovation and invention
- Simplify complex problems
- Be externally aware
- Accept being misunderstood

*Tags: #Innovation #Simplification #Invention #ExternalAwareness*

---

## 4. Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**Key Points:**
- Demonstrate strong judgment
- Develop good instincts
- Seek diverse perspectives
- Challenge your own beliefs

*Tags: #Judgment #DecisionMaking #DiversePerspectives #SelfChallenge*

---

## 5. Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**Key Points:**
- Continuous learning mindset
- Self-improvement focus
- Curiosity about possibilities
- Take action to explore

*Tags: #ContinuousLearning #Curiosity #SelfImprovement #Growth*

---

## 6. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.

**Key Points:**
- Raise the performance bar
- Recognize exceptional talent
- Develop future leaders
- Take coaching seriously

*Tags: #TalentDevelopment #Hiring #Coaching #Leadership*

---

## 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes.

**Key Points:**
- Maintain relentlessly high standards
- Continuously raise the bar
- Drive quality in everything
- Don't compromise on excellence

*Tags: #HighStandards #Excellence #Quality #RaisingTheBar*

---

## 8. Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

**Key Points:**
- Avoid thinking small
- Create bold direction
- Inspire through vision
- Think differently

*Tags: #BigThinking #Vision #Bold #Innovation*

---

## 9. Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.

**Key Points:**
- Speed matters
- Many decisions are reversible
- Avoid analysis paralysis
- Take calculated risks

*Tags: #BiasForAction #Speed #RiskTaking #Execution*

---

## 10. Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

**Key Points:**
- Do more with less
- Embrace constraints
- Be resourceful and self-sufficient
- Focus on results, not resources

*Tags: #Frugality #Resourcefulness #Efficiency #Constraints*

---

## 11. Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.

**Key Points:**
- Listen attentively
- Speak candidly
- Treat others respectfully
- Be self-critical

*Tags: #Trust #Respect #SelfCritical #Candor*

---

## 12. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.

**Key Points:**
- Stay connected to details
- Operate at all levels
- Audit frequently
- Be skeptical of inconsistencies

*Tags: #DiveDeep #Details #Skeptical #HandsOn*

---

## 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

**Key Points:**
- Challenge decisions respectfully
- Speak up when you disagree
- Commit fully once decided
- Show courage in disagreement

*Tags: #Backbone #DisagreeAndCommit #Courage #Commitment*

---

## 14. Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

**Key Points:**
- Focus on key inputs
- Deliver with quality and timeliness
- Rise to the occasion
- Never settle

*Tags: #DeliverResults #Quality #Timeliness #Resilience*

---

## 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun.

**Key Points:**
- Create safe and productive environment
- Foster diversity and inclusion
- Lead with empathy
- Make work enjoyable

*Tags: #BestEmployer #Empathy #Diversity #WorkEnvironment*

---

## 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions.

**Key Points:**
- Acknowledge scale and impact
- Consider secondary effects
- Stay humble
- Think about broader responsibility

*Tags: #Responsibility #Scale #Humility #Impact*

## Interview Tips

When preparing for Amazon interviews, remember:

1. **Use the STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioral questions
2. **Be specific** with examples that demonstrate these principles
3. **Show ownership** in your stories
4. **Demonstrate customer focus** in your examples
5. **Highlight learning and growth** from failures
6. **Quantify results** whenever possible
