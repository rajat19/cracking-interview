## Intent
- Provide a unified, simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- Define a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- Wrap a complex subsystem with a simpler interface.

## Problem
Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or framework. Ordinarily, you'd need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on.

As a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled to the implementation details of 3rd-party classes, making it hard to comprehend and maintain.

## Structure

The Facade pattern suggests that you wrap a complex subsystem with a simpler interface. The facade hides most of the complexity by having the facade communicate with subsystem classes on your behalf.

The Facade provides convenient access to a particular part of the subsystem's functionality. It knows where to direct the client's request and how to operate all the moving parts.

## Example

When you call a shop to place a phone order, an operator is your facade to all services and departments of the shop. The operator provides you with a simple voice interface to the ordering system, payment gateways, and various delivery services.

Similarly, a video conversion facade might provide a simple method like `convertVideo(filename, format)` while internally coordinating between video/audio codecs, filters, and various format libraries.

## Checklist

1. Check whether it's possible to provide a simpler interface than what an existing subsystem already provides. You're on the right track if this interface makes the client code independent from many of the subsystem's classes.
2. Declare and implement this interface in a new facade class. The facade should redirect the calls from the client code to appropriate objects of the subsystem. The facade should be responsible for initializing the subsystem and managing its lifecycle unless the client code already does this.
3. To get the full benefit from the pattern, make all the client code communicate with the subsystem only via the facade. Now the client code is protected from any changes in the subsystem code. For example, when a subsystem gets upgraded to a new version, you will only need to modify the code in the facade.
4. If the facade becomes too big, consider extracting part of its behavior to a new, refined facade class.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem
- Reduces coupling between the client and subsystem
- Provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem
- Can be used to layer a system and define entry points to each level

**Cons:**
- A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app
- May limit access to advanced features of the subsystem
- Adds an additional layer of indirection

## Rule of thumb

- Facade defines a new interface for existing objects, whereas Adapter tries to make the existing interface usable. Adapter usually wraps just one object, while Facade works with an entire subsystem of objects.
- Abstract Factory can serve as an alternative to Facade when you only want to hide the way the subsystem objects are created from the client code.
- Flyweight shows how to make lots of little objects, whereas Facade shows how to make a single object represent an entire subsystem.
- Facade is similar to Proxy in that both buffer a complex entity and initialize it on their own. Unlike Facade, Proxy has the same interface as its service object, which makes them interchangeable.
- Facade classes can often be transformed into Singletons since a single facade object is sufficient in most cases.
- Mediator and Facade have similar jobs: they try to organize collaboration between lots of tightly coupled classes. Facade defines a simplified interface to a subsystem of objects, but it doesn't introduce any new functionality. The subsystem itself is unaware of the facade. Objects within the subsystem can communicate directly. Mediator centralizes communication between components of the system. The components only know about the mediator object and don't communicate directly.
