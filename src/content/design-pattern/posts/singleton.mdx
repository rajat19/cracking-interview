## Intent
- Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it
- Encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on first use"
- Control instantiation of a class to one and only one instance

## Problem

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:

**Ensure that a class has just a single instance.** Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason is to control access to some shared resourceâ€”for example, a database or a file. Here's how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you'll get the one you already created.

**Provide a global access point to that instance.** Remember those global variables that you (all right, me) used to store some essential objects? While they're very handy, they're also very unsafe since any code can potentially overwrite the contents of those variables and crash the app.

## Structure

The Singleton class declares the static method `getInstance` that returns the same instance of its own class. The Singleton's constructor should be hidden from the client code. Calling the `getInstance` method should be the only way of getting the Singleton object.

All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:
- Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator with the Singleton class
- Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field

## Example

The government is an excellent example of the Singleton pattern. A country can have only one official government. Regardless of the personal identities of the individuals who form governments, the title, "The Government of X", is a global point of access that identifies the group of people in charge.

Similarly, a database connection pool, cache, thread pool, or logger are real-world examples where you want to ensure only one instance exists to avoid conflicts and maintain consistency.

## Implementation Checklist

1. Add a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance
2. Declare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance
3. Implement "lazy initialization" inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return that instance on all subsequent calls
4. Make the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects
5. Go over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton's constructor with calls to its static creation method

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Guarantees that a class has only a single instance
- Gain a global access point to that instance
- The singleton object is initialized only when it's requested for the first time

**Cons:**
- Violates the Single Responsibility Principle. The pattern solves two problems at the time
- The Singleton pattern can mask bad design, for instance, when the components of the program know too much about each other
- The pattern requires special treatment in a multithreaded environment so that multiple threads won't create a singleton object several times
- It may be difficult to unit test the client code of the Singleton because many test frameworks rely on inheritance when producing mock objects

## Rules of Thumb

- A Facade class can often be transformed into a Singleton since a single facade object is sufficient in most cases
- Flyweight would resemble Singleton if you somehow managed to reduce all shared states of the objects to just one flyweight object. But there are two fundamental differences between these patterns: there should be only one Singleton instance, whereas a Flyweight class can have multiple instances with different intrinsic states
- Abstract Factories, Builders and Prototypes can all be implemented as Singletons
- State objects are often singletons
- Singleton should be considered only if all three of the following criteria are satisfied: ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned, lazy initialization is desirable, and global access is not otherwise provided
