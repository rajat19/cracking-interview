# Atlassian Values

Atlassian's core values define who they are as a company and guide how they work together, make decisions, and treat customers and each other.

## 1. Open Company, No Bullshit

Openness is root level for us. Information is open internally by default and sharing is a first principle. We understand that speaking your mind requires equal parts brains, thoughtfulness, and caring.

**What this means:**
- Default to transparency
- Share information openly
- Speak your mind thoughtfully
- Be honest and direct
- No hidden agendas

**In practice:**
- Share knowledge freely across teams
- Give honest feedback
- Admit when you don't know something
- Challenge ideas constructively
- Be transparent about mistakes

## 2. Build with Heart and Balance

Passion and urgency infuse everything we do, alongside the wisdom to consider options fully and with care. Then we make the cut, and we get to work.

**What this means:**
- Bring passion to your work
- Balance urgency with thoughtfulness
- Consider all options carefully
- Make decisive cuts when needed
- Execute with commitment

**In practice:**
- Show enthusiasm for your projects

## 3. Don't #@!% the Customer

Customers are our lifeblood. Without happy customers, we're doomed. So considering the customer perspective—collectively, not just a handful—comes first.

**What this means:**
- Put customers first in all decisions
- Consider the broader customer base
- Understand customer pain points
- Deliver value to customers
- Build trust through reliability

**In practice:**
- Ask "How does this help our customers?"
- Listen to customer feedback
- Test solutions with real users
- Fix customer issues quickly
- Build products customers love

## 4. Play, as a Team

We spend a huge amount of our time at work. So the more that time doesn't feel like "work," the better. We can be serious, without taking ourselves too seriously. We strive to put what's right for the team first.

**What this means:**
- Make work enjoyable
- Don't take yourself too seriously
- Prioritize team success over individual glory
- Support your teammates
- Create a positive work environment

**In practice:**
- Help teammates when they're struggling
- Celebrate team wins together
- Share credit generously
- Have fun while working hard
- Build strong relationships

## 5. Be the Change You Seek

All Atlassians should have the courage and resourcefulness to spark change—to make better our products, our people, our place. Continuous improvement is a shared responsibility. Action is an independent one.

**What this means:**
- Take initiative to drive change
- Don't wait for permission to improve things
- Be resourceful in finding solutions
- Own continuous improvement
- Act independently when needed

**In practice:**
- Identify problems and propose solutions
- Experiment with new approaches
- Learn from failures and iterate
- Take ownership of improvements
- Lead by example
