There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, 
nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k (1 <= k < nums.length)` 
such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0],nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). 
For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of target if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in nums.

## Test Cases

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
