## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The input binary string **1011** has a total of three set bits.
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 128
Output: 1
Explanation: 
The input binary string **10000000** has a total of one set bit.
```
**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2147483645
Output: 30
Explanation: 
The input binary string **1111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty set bits.
```
 

**Constraints:**

	
* `1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`

 

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
