Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end times `[[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...]` (start_i < end_i), 
determine if a person could add all meetings to their schedule without any conflicts.

## Test Cases

**Example 1:** 
```
Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: false
Explanation:
(0,30) and (5,10) will conflict
(0,30) and (15,20) will conflict
```

**Example 2:** 
```
Input: intervals = [(5,8),(9,15)]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= intervals.length <= 500`
* `0 <= intervals[i].start < intervals[i].end <= 1,000,000`
