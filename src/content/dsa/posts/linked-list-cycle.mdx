Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true`* if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png" style="width: 300px; height: 97px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;" />
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png" style="width: 141px; height: 74px;" />
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png" style="width: 45px; height: 45px;" />
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
``` 

**Constraints:**
	
* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
* `-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
* `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
