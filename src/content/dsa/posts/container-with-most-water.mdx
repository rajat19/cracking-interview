You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 287px;" />
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```
 

**Constraints:**

	
* `n == height.length`
	
* `2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
	
* `0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
