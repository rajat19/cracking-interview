You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true`* if you can reach the last index, or *`false`* otherwise*.

 

---
## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```
 

**Constraints:**

	
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
	
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
