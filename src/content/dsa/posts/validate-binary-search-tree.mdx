Given the `root` of a binary tree, *determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)*.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

	
* The left <span data-keyword="subtree">subtree</span> of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly less than** the node's key.
	
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly greater than** the node's key.
	
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg" style="width: 302px; height: 182px;" />
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 292px;" />
```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```
 

**Constraints:**

	
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
	
* `-2<sup>31</sup> <= Node.val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
