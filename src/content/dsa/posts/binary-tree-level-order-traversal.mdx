## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg" style="width: 277px; height: 302px;" />
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```
**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
 

**Constraints:**

	
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
	
* `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
