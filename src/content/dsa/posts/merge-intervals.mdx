Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]`, 
merge all overlapping intervals, 
and return *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*. 

---
## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
Output: [[1,7]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.
```
 
**Constraints:**

* `1 <= intervals.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`	
* `intervals[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= start<sub>i</sub> <= end<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
