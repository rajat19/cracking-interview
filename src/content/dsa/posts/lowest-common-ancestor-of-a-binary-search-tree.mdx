Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor" target="_blank">definition of LCA on Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).&rdquo;

## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png" style="width: 200px; height: 190px;" />
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```
**Example 2:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png" style="width: 200px; height: 190px;" />
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```
**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```
 

**Constraints:**

	
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10<sup>5</sup>]`.
	
* `-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
	
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
	
* `p != q`
	
* `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.
