Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *its maximum depth*.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Test Cases
**Example 1:**

<MdxImage alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 277px;" />
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```
 

**Constraints:**

	
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
	
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
