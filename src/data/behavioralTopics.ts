## Example Answer
"I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp where I lead a team of 5 developers building scalable microservices. In my current role, I've successfully migrated our monolithic architecture to microservices, which improved our deployment frequency by 300% and reduced downtime by 90%.

Previously, I worked at StartupXYZ where I was one of the first engineers. I helped scale the platform from 1,000 to 100,000 users and learned how to build systems under tight constraints and rapid growth.

I'm excited about this opportunity because I want to work on even larger scale challenges and contribute to a product that impacts millions of users. I'm particularly interested in your team's work on distributed systems and machine learning."

## Tips
- Keep it to 2-3 minutes
- Focus on professional experience
- Tailor to the specific role
- Practice until it feels natural
- End with enthusiasm for the role`

    title: "What's Your Greatest Weakness?",
    difficulty: "medium",
    description: "A tricky question that tests self-awareness and growth mindset.",
    content: `# What's Your Greatest Weakness?

## Purpose
Interviewers want to assess:
- Self-awareness
- Ability to receive feedback
- Growth mindset
- Honesty and authenticity

## Strategy
1. **Choose a real weakness** (not a strength in disguise)
2. **Show self-awareness** about how it impacts your work
3. **Demonstrate action** you're taking to improve
4. **Show progress** you've made

## Framework
1. State the weakness honestly
2. Explain how you recognized it
3. Describe specific steps you're taking
4. Share evidence of improvement

## Example Answer
"I've historically struggled with public speaking and presenting to large groups. I noticed this was holding me back when I had opportunities to present our team's work to leadership but felt too anxious to volunteer.

To address this, I joined Toastmasters six months ago and have been practicing regularly. I also started volunteering to give tech talks at our weekly team meetings. Last month, I successfully presented our quarterly results to the entire engineering organization - something I wouldn't have been able to do a year ago.

While I'm still working on this skill, I've become much more comfortable speaking up in meetings and sharing my ideas with the team."

## What NOT to Say
- "I'm a perfectionist" (clich√©)
- "I work too hard" (not a real weakness)
- "I have no weaknesses" (shows lack of self-awareness)
- Critical weaknesses for the role (if applying for a leadership role, don't say you're bad with people)

## Tips
- Choose something that won't directly impact the role
- Show that you're actively working on it
- Demonstrate growth and learning
- Be genuine and specific`

    title: "STAR Method for Behavioral Questions",
    difficulty: "easy",
    description: "A framework for structuring compelling answers to behavioral interview questions.",
    content: `# STAR Method

## What is STAR?
STAR is a framework for answering behavioral questions by providing specific examples:

- **S**ituation: Set the context
- **T**ask: Describe your responsibility
- **A**ction: Explain what you did
- **R**esult: Share the outcome

## When to Use STAR
Use STAR for questions that start with:
- "Tell me about a time when..."
- "Give me an example of..."
- "Describe a situation where..."
- "How did you handle..."

## STAR Breakdown

### Situation (Context)
- Where and when did this happen?
- Who was involved?
- What was the background/challenge?
- Keep it brief but provide enough context

### Task (Your Responsibility)
- What was your specific role?
- What were you trying to achieve?
- What were the stakes/constraints?

### Action (What You Did)
- This is the most important part
- Be specific about YOUR actions
- Use "I" not "we"
- Explain your thought process
- Include any challenges you faced

### Result (Outcome)
- What happened as a result of your actions?
- Use specific metrics when possible
- Include both immediate and long-term results
- What did you learn?

## Example STAR Answer
**Question**: "Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult team member."

**Situation**: "In my previous role, I was working on a critical product launch with a team of 6 engineers. One team member, John, was consistently missing deadlines and not communicating his blockers, which was putting our launch timeline at risk."

**Task**: "As the tech lead, I needed to address this issue while maintaining team morale and ensuring we could still meet our launch deadline."

**Action**: "I first had a private one-on-one conversation with John to understand if there were any personal issues or if he needed additional support. I discovered he was struggling with a particular technology and was too embarrassed to ask for help. I paired him with our senior engineer for mentoring and adjusted his tasks to better match his current skill level. I also implemented daily check-ins with the whole team to identify blockers early."

**Result**: "As a result, John's performance improved significantly, and we launched the product on time. The mentoring relationship continued beyond the project, and John became one of our most reliable team members. I learned the importance of proactive communication and creating psychological safety for team members to ask for help."

## Tips for Great STAR Answers
- Prepare 5-7 STAR stories covering different scenarios
- Use recent examples (within last 2-3 years)
- Choose stories that show you in a positive light
- Practice telling them concisely (2-3 minutes max)
- Tailor examples to the role you're applying for`

    id: "conflict-resolution",
    title: "Handling Conflicts at Work",
    difficulty: "medium",
    description: "How to discuss workplace conflicts and demonstrate your conflict resolution skills.",
    content: `# Handling Conflicts at Work

## Common Questions
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague"
- "Describe a conflict you had at work and how you resolved it"
- "How do you handle disagreements with your manager?"

## Types of Workplace Conflicts
1. **Technical disagreements** (architecture, approach, tools)
2. **Process conflicts** (how work gets done, timelines)
3. **Resource conflicts** (competing priorities, limited resources)
4. **Communication issues** (misunderstandings, different styles)
5. **Value conflicts** (different priorities, work styles)

## Conflict Resolution Framework
### 1. Stay Professional
- Focus on the issue, not the person
- Use "I" statements instead of "you" statements
- Keep emotions in check
- Listen actively to understand their perspective

### 2. Understand the Root Cause
- What are the underlying concerns?
- Are there different goals or priorities?
- Is it a communication issue?
- Are there external pressures?

### 3. Find Common Ground
- What do you both agree on?
- What are shared goals?
- What are mutual interests?

### 4. Collaborate on Solutions
- Brainstorm alternatives together
- Be willing to compromise
- Focus on win-win outcomes
- Agree on next steps

## Example STAR Answer
**Question**: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague."

**Situation**: "During a major system redesign, my colleague Sarah and I had a significant disagreement about the database architecture. She wanted to use a NoSQL solution, while I believed a relational database was more appropriate for our use case."

**Task**: "We needed to make a decision quickly as the rest of the development team was waiting for the architecture to be finalized. Both of us were senior engineers, so there wasn't a clear hierarchy to resolve the disagreement."

**Action**: "Instead of continuing to argue our positions, I suggested we take a step back and list our requirements and constraints on a whiteboard. We identified what was most important: data consistency, query complexity, team expertise, and timeline. I proposed that we each research and present the pros and cons of both approaches based on these criteria. After our presentations, we realized that while NoSQL might be better long-term, our team's expertise with relational databases and the tight timeline made SQL the pragmatic choice for this project."

**Result**: "We decided to go with the relational database for the initial launch, with a plan to evaluate NoSQL for future iterations once we had more bandwidth. The project launched successfully on time, and Sarah and I actually became closer colleagues because we learned to respect each other's expertise and approach to problem-solving."

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Blaming the other person entirely
- Getting emotional or personal
- Refusing to compromise
- Not taking any responsibility
- Unresolved conflicts
- Conflicts that damaged relationships permanently

## Key Takeaways to Demonstrate
- Professional communication skills
- Ability to see multiple perspectives
- Problem-solving and negotiation skills
- Emotional intelligence
- Focus on business outcomes
